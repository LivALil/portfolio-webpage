      <h3> About Me👀!</h3>

        <p> As a father and student, I continue to thrive to become the best version of myself. </p> 

        <p> Started gaming when I was about 8 years old. The older I became the more i started questioning how any of it was even possible. When I was 14 I started looking into careers surrounding computer science. My school didnt offer computer programs so I waited until college to take my first shot at learning code, now im a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. </p>

        <p> Outside of building a career, I like to do things like: </p> 
            <ol> 
                <li><i> Play Sports </i></li>
                <li><i> Go To Amusement Parks/Festivals </i></li> 
                <li><i> Spend time with my kids </i></li>
                <li><i> Travel </i></li>
                <li><i> Gaming </i></li>
            </ol>

        <p> Man with many personalities! </p>
